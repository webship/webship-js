# CI / CD setup

Webship-js ships ready-to-use config files for every major CI/CD provider. The pattern is the same everywhere: install Node 20, install Playwright's chromium with its system deps, start the fixture server on port 8080, run `npm test`. No build step — `tsx` transpiles `.ts` step files on the fly.

## Supported providers

| Provider | File | Account needed | Badge |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub Actions | `.github/workflows/github-actions.yml` | GitHub | yes |
| GitLab CI | `.gitlab-ci.yml` | GitLab | yes |
| CircleCI | `.circleci/config.yml` | CircleCI | yes |
| Bitbucket Pipelines | `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` | Bitbucket | yes |
| Travis CI | `.travis.yml` | travis-ci.com | yes |
| Jenkins | `Jenkinsfile` | self-hosted | no |

Each provider's setup notes live in its own section below.

## Jenkins

**File**: `Jenkinsfile` (declarative pipeline, at repo root).

Jenkins has no SaaS — you run a controller yourself. The shipped `Jenkinsfile` uses the official `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.58.2-jammy` Docker image so chromium and every apt dependency are already inside.

### Setup steps

1. **Run a Jenkins controller**. Fastest path is Docker:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name jenkins \
     -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 \
     -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \
     -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
     --group-add $(stat -c '%g' /var/run/docker.sock) \
     jenkins/jenkins:lts
   ```
   The mount + `--group-add` are critical — the pipeline spawns a sibling container for the Playwright image and needs the host's Docker socket.
2. **First-run unlock**: `docker logs jenkins | grep -A 1 "initialAdminPassword"` → paste at `http://localhost:8080`. Pick **Install suggested plugins**. That set already includes the Docker Pipeline plugin we rely on.
3. **Create an admin user** when prompted.
4. **Configure GitHub credentials**: *Manage Jenkins → Credentials → System → Global → Add* → kind `Username with password` (or `SSH Username with private key`), id `github-creds`.
5. **New Item → Pipeline**. Name `webship-js`.
   - *Build Triggers*: `Poll SCM` `H/5 * * * *` or `GitHub hook trigger`.
   - *Pipeline*: `Pipeline script from SCM` → Git → repo URL → credential `github-creds` → branch `*/2.0.x` → script path `Jenkinsfile`.
6. **Save** → **Build Now**. First run pulls the Playwright image (~1 GB) — cached afterwards.

### Reports + screenshots

The `post { always }` block archives `tests/reports/cucumber_report.{html,pdf,json}` and any `screenshots/**`. Browse them per build in the Jenkins UI under "Build Artifacts".

### Badge

Jenkins has no public badge endpoint by default — the controller is usually private. If you expose Jenkins publicly, use the **Embeddable Build Status** plugin which provides `BASE/buildStatus/icon?job=webship-js&style=plastic` and paste that URL in `README.md`.

### Notes

- `args '-u root:root'` runs the container as root so `npm install` and `npx playwright install --with-deps` can touch system paths. Switch to a non-root image if you tighten security.
- The Playwright base image already has every browser dep, so `--with-deps` is a no-op — kept for symmetry with other lanes.
- Need parallelism? Wrap the `Test` stage in `parallel { stage('chromium') {...}; stage('firefox') {...} }` and switch the image to `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright` (latest) which includes all three browsers.
